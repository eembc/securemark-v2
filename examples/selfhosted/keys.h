Tips for generating RSA keys and signatures with openssl...

openssl3 genrsa -out pri.pem 4096
openssl3 rsa -in pri.pem -pubout -out pub.pem

openssl3 rsa -in pri.pem -inform pem -out pri.der -outform der
openssl3 rsa -pubin -inform pem -in pub.pem -outform der -out pub.der

openssl3 dgst -sha256 -sign pri.der -out sig.dat msg.txt

xxd -i pub.der | grep 0x | sed 's/ //g'
xxd -i sig.dat | grep 0x | sed 's/ //g'

prime256v1 -> p256r1
secp384r1  -> p384r1

openssl3 ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out pri.der -outform der
openssl3 ec -in pri.der -inform der -pubout -out pub.der -outform der
openssl3 dgst -sha256 -sign pri.der -out sig.dat msg.txt

xxd -i sig.dat | grep 0x | sed 's/ //g'

OpenSSL creates ASN.1 encoded keys with OID, but we need uncompressed so
just extract from the 04 on.


openssl3 genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out pri.der -outform der
openssl3 pkey -inform der -in pri.der -pubout -out pub.der -outform der
